# CoMP Networks Simulation
Codes for CoMP networks in-depth simulation. 
 
* Java used for simulation codes (and preliminary graph generation)
* MATLAB used for (final) graph generation

## Metrics simulated include the following :

### Average metrics against traffic rate

- Avg throughput considering **all** UEs (using SINR, Shanon's formula)
- Avg throughput considering only **active** UEs (using SINR, Shanon's formula)
- Cell-Edge Throughput
- Proportion of active UEs
- Proportion of dropped UEs
- Effective traffic
- Entropy
- Discrimination Index
- Jain's Fairness Index
- Spectral Efficiency
- Avg Throughput

### Additional metrics

- Average throughput vs Number of Co-ordinating Base-Stations (Conventional, DPS, JT=2,3,4,5)
- Variation by including/not including the concept of a **dummy ring**.
